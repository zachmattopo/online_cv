# online_cv

An online version of my CV, built with Flutter. Visit the live site at https://zachmattopo.github.io/online-cv-live/.

## Objective of this repository:

1. To showcase my professional experience and portfolio.
2. And at the same time, to showcase my code work (code structuring and architecture). Feel free to browse around in the repo!


* Please note: Some parts of the app are still WIP e.g.:
  - The separation of UI and business logic (repository/data fetch layer).
  - Minor TODOs for responsive UI on mobile.
